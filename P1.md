# Finding Lane Lines on the Road
## Overview
In this project, I used Python and OpenCV to detect lane lines on the road images and applied it to process some road test videos. I have learnt and applied the following main techniques to this project:
- Color spaces and filter
- Canny Edge detection
- Gaussian Blur
- Region of Interest selection
- Hough transform lines detection
## Lane finding pipeline
In order to process a road image to find lane lines, I implemented the pipeline with 6 steps: filter yellow and white on image, gray scaling, gaussian blue, edges detection, region of interest selection, hough transform detection. After that, I need to modify the draw_line() function by averagating and extraploating lines based on slope and intercept, draw lines on original image.
I showed the output images for each step in order to debug and parameter turning. I can process two first videos not difficulity but there are many difficults on the challenge video. I have tried to capture some challenge images from challenge video and added them to the test images. You can open and run the [source file](https://github.com/HiepTang/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/P1.ipynb) for more detail and results at each step.               
The following are the detail of each step
### Filter yellow and white colors on image
I assumed that the main colors for lane lines are yellow and white. So in order to reduce the noise on road images, I filtered on image by focusing only on yellow and white colors. I have referenced to [Naoki's article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/finding-lane-lines-on-the-road-30cf016a1165) for this step.
### Gray scaling
